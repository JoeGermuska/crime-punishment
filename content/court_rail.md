### How to Access the Data

In Illinois, and at the Federal level, the courts do not have to abide by the Freedom of Information Act. The Chicago Justice Project [has released 5 years of Cook County Court Conviction Data](http://www.chicagojustice.org/foi/data-sets-available-for-download/cook-county-court-data), which they were successful in requesting. 

Court records are also deemed to be open for public inspection and can be viewed during normal working hours by going to the appropriate Circuit Court to view them. The [Cook County Clerk of the Circuit Court](http://www.cookcountyclerkofcourt.org/) maintains both the court paper records and the electronic data the courts generate. 

To attempt to get access to additional electronic court data you have to [file a request for such data with the Chief Judge's office](http://www.cookcountygov.com/portal/server.pt/community/chief_judge,_office_of_the/261). If your request is approved it is then sent to the Circuit Court Clerk's office and they will provide you the data.

### National Models for Releasing Justice Data  

##### Maryland Courts  

[The Maryland Courts](http://casesearch.courts.state.md.us/inquiry/processDisclaimer.jis) allow access to the most robust amount of data of any court we located. Their website lists what occurs in every court hearing while also detailing information regarding the officer that arrested the defendant, the prosecutor(s) prosecuting the case, and the judge presiding over the case. This site also details information regarding the defendant's lawyer. Not a single court would allow the bulk downloading of data involved in the cases.
