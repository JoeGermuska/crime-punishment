### How to Access the Data

Some Jail data is visualized by the [26th and California Project](http://26thandcalifornia.recoveredfactory.net), and corresponding raw data is available through the [Cook County Jail API](https://github.com/sc3/cookcountyjail/wiki/API-guide) project. Both of these projects in turn get their information from the single inmate search function of the [Cook County Inmate Locator](http://www2.cookcountysheriff.org/search2/).

To access greater or more specific data from the Cook County Jail, you need to [file a request for data under Illinois' Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)](http://www.statesattorney.org/about_the_office.html). You will need to send an email including: **(1)** *your name and contact information*, along with **(2)** *a description of the records you are requesting*. Please try to be reasonably specific for the data you are looking for so that they can more easily process your request.

### National Models for Releasing Justice Data  

##### King County (Washington)  

[King County, Washington](https://data.kingcounty.gov/browse?&tags=jail+inmate), is far and away the leader of the pack when it comes to making jail data available and useful. Countless counties throughout the US allow for individuals to go to their website and allow you to search for the status of a single inmate by either name or jail identification number. This seems opt be the standard across the US that the vast majority of jails are striving for. Occasionally included in this limited search is some analysis of the cost to house jail detainees and population analysis over time.  

It is only King County that makes data regarding their inmates available in machine ready format that allows you to either visual the data online or download it in your preferred format. The portal works exactly like the City of Chicago data portal. It is not the easiest to use to find data about a single inmate but it is far superior to any other county's site in making large amount of data about their detainees available for analysis.
