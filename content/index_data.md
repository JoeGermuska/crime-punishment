## About the Data
<hr>
For each contact point with the law, we divide the data that is known to be collected into three catagories based on its accessibility. Data marked "Open" is data that can be accessed online for free without prior permission. Data marked "FOIA" is data that can be requested under Illinois' Freedom of Information Act. We also have a category for data is confirmed to be inaccessible even through the FOIA.
