### How to Access the Data

The "Open Data" below is available through single inmate search on the [IDOC website](https://www2.illinois.gov/idoc/Offender/Pages/default.aspx). There is no bulk data made available. It is unclear what more data is collected. 

It's also unclear what data is available through Illinois' Freedom of Information Act. Requesting more data from the Illinois Department of Corrections is still possible, though, by [filing a request for data under Illinois' Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)](https://www2.illinois.gov/idoc/Pages/FreedomofInformationAct.aspx). You will need to send an email including: **(1)** *your name and contact information*, along with **(2)** *a description of the records you are requesting*. Please try to be reasonably specific for the data you are looking for so that they can more easily process your request.

### National Models for Releasing Justice Data

##### Oregon, USA

The state of Oregon makes a very large amount of data about their prison available through their [data portal](https://data.oregon.gov/browse?q=Prison%20&sortBy=relevance&utf8=%E2%9C%93). This includes forecasts of prison populations, census of current prison populations by institutions, and admissions data. The amount and quality of the data definitely makes Oregon the national standard for transparency in correctional data.
